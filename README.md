# Detection-of-Currency-Notes-and-Medicine-Names-for-Visually-impaired-using-Deep-learnings-
Artificial Intelligence is outgrowing in demand in every sector in recent years. Deep Learning is playing an important role in solving complex problems related to images. Despite being in a digital world where UPI transactions have increased tremendously, However, there is a section of the population who are visually impaired people who are deprived of using digital transaction features. We have analyzed this problem and come to a consensus that deep learning can overcome the problems faced by visually impaired people. The model is more focused on recognizing the Indian currency note and medicine names as well as object detection. The additional feature of this model includes the audio output of the results. In this model, we have used a dataset of ‘Indian Currency Note’ which widely covers the currency notes which are in circulation as per RBI. For example, it excludes one rupee, two rupee, five rupee and one thousand rupee notes. The data is trained and tested which is one of the preliminary activities in order to achieve the accuracy of the model. Also we have adding medicine name detection in these. This can be used on the medicines and get the name of that medicine followed by an audio.
